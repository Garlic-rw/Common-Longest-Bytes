# Common-Longest-Bytes

Given a large number of binary files, write a program that finds the
longest strand of bytes that is identical between two or more files

Use the test set attached (files sample.*)

The program should display:
- the length of the strand
- the file names where the largest strand appears
- the offset where the strand appears in each file

To run this program locally, please put the binary files under the /samples directory.
